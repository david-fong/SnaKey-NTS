/**
 * A language is a map from a collection of unique characters to
 * corresponding key-sequences. the key-sequences may be non-unique.
 * (try searching up "Chinese riddle where each syllable is pronounced
 * 'shi'"). A character may have more than one corresponding sequence,
 * representing alternate "spellings" (ways of typing it).
 *
 * ### From Typeable Sequences to Written Characters
 *
 * To the game internals, the reverse thinking is more important: As
 * a map from typeable key-sequences to sets of language-unique written
 * characters (no character is mapped by multiple key-sequences). We
 * do not require support for retrieving the sequence corresponding to
 * a written character.
 *
 * ### Implementation Guide
 *
 * See the readme in [the implementations folder](./impl/readme.md)
 * for a guide on writing implementations of this class.

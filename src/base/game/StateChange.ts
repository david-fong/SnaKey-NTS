		 * ### Client Request
		 *
		 * The ID of the last request made by this player that the server
		 * _accepted_. A requester cannot send a new request to
		 * the Game Manager until it has received the Game Manager's
		 * response to the last request it made.
		 *
		 * ### Server Response
		 *
		 * If the server accepts the request, it must broadcast a response
		 * with this field set to the incremented value.
		 *
		 * If it rejects this request, it must directly acknowledge its
		 * receipt of the request (no need to broadcast to all clients)
		 * with this field unchanged.
		 *
		 * ### Things that should never happen
		 *
		 * If the Game Manager receives a request with a value in
		 * this field lower than the one it set in its last response to the
		 * requester, this would mean that the requester didn't wait for a
		 * response to its previous request, which it is not supposed to do.
		 *
		 * **Note:** If the above requirement is ever changed, (in
		 * addition to other mechanisms I haven't reasoned through,) this
		 * field's spec should change to require _all_ server responses to
		 * have this field set to an incremented value, including rejects.
		 *
		 * The server should never receive a request with a value higher
		 * than the one it provided in its last response to this requester.

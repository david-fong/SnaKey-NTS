/**
 * All events have two corresponding handler functions taking a
 * request descriptor object ("desc"):
 *
 * ### Request Processor
 *
 * The request processor is only used by the Game Manager. It decides
 * whether to accept or reject the request based on `desc` and may
 * throw exceptions on impossible arguments. It should not make any
 * changes to the game state. Instead, it is responsible to augment
 * `desc` with information describing what changes to the game state
 * must be made.
 *
 * ### Request Executor
 *
 * This takes the `desc` augmented by the request processor and enacts
 * all the described changes upon the game's state. If the Game Manager
 * is not local to the client (a server process), then this handler is
 * called at both the server and client.
 *
 * Updates the event record if the response is accepted.

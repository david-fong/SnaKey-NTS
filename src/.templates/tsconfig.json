// Since the parent template and this one don't have a "files" or an
// "includes" field, all the files in the folder containing the concrete
// config will be part of its reference group.
//
// Note that the fields are not actually taken in a strictly dumb
// fashion. According to vscode, "rootDir" is used relative to this
// file and not the concrete config files, although the final value
// is the same.
//
// If general changes are made to this file, make similar changes to
// /test/.templates/tsconfig.json, which is essentially a copy of this.
//
// Note that the baseUrl is set to the "base/" folder. This is because
// The other src/* subprojects only reference externals under the base.
// This will reduce on unnecessary visual clutter. This means that all
// the non-base src/* subprojects should use relative imports for their
// own internals only. This is also reflected in the WebPack config.
// This makes it feel as though the "offline", "server" and "client"
// folders were under the "base" folder from the standpoint of someone
// writing and maintaining imports.

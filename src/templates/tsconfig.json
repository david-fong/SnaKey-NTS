// Since the parent template and this one don't have a "files" or an
// "includes" field, all the files in the folder containing the concrete
// config will be part of its reference group.
//
// Note that the fields are not actually taken in a strictly dumb
// fashion. According to vscode, "rootDir" is used relative to this
// file and not the concrete config files, although the final value
// is the same.
// TODO: make each concrete config be like the lang/ one.

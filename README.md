# ‚å®üêç SnaKey

[**`try it!` üëà**](index.html "*boop*")

At its core, SnaKey is a typing game where you move around by typing keyboard sequences corresponding to characters from written languages. For example, playing with English, if there was a tile adjacent to your player character marked by the written character "a", to move on it, you would type the keyboard sequence "a". If you were playing with Japanese Hiragana, you would type the keyboard sequence "no" to move onto an adjacent tile marked by the written character "„ÅÆ".

SnaKey drew some initial inspiration from the well-known [Snake Game](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)), hence its name, which is a pun on the words "snake" and "keyboard".

## My Goals and Why I do This

For me, there are three purposes / goals for my continued work on this project. In order of precedence, they are:

### üí° I have an idea that matters to me

I like the idea of this game, and I want to champion it. Although it didn't fall out of the sky and hit me in the head, [it kind of feels that way](https://www.ted.com/talks/ok_go_how_to_find_a_wonderful_idea). And while I don't know for a fact whether or not anything exactly like this has ever been made, it gives me the thrill of at least being something that I have never seen anyone do, or been asked to do, and that I am not simultaneously trying to solve separately with more than sixty other people that I see every day. I'll talk more about why this idea matters to me in my reflection on my work in previous versions of this project.

### üçè I want to learn and push myself

This is not a pure goal, but one that comes naturally from having one. That is- to achieve my goal of make my idea a reality, I need to learn things. First I need to learn _what I need to learn_ to achieve my goal, and read up on the available choices in order to make a basic, educated decision on what technologies to pursue learning, and then I need to actually learn them. First it was Python, and then it was HTML, Javascript, and CSS, and now, it's NodeJS, expressJS, SocketIO, VSCode, eslint, and Typescript.

One of the plus sides of pushing myself in this way is that historically, it has always come in handy later in school assignments where I would otherwise be learning these things from scratch. The nicest thing about having a pure goal by far is that it takes a lot of the drag out of learning. One thing I feel a little tired of in my experience with school is how the technical material often seems to creep into the spotlight in the place of pure goals and practical applications. It's refreshing to start with a goal at the forefront of my mind.

### üíº I want to build up my portfolio

By this, I mean that I aim to make something polished, and something that communicates my journey with the design, as well as the interesting parts of the design itself. This is because I expect that the things I make and learn will not only transfer to some benefit in school-related work, but also in wherever I go during COOP terms and after graduation. While this is the least of my goals, that isn't to say that it doesn't change my approach to my work. The intent I have to share my process and design in addition to the final product gives me the extra motivation to to do things like write good documentation. It's like keeping a house clean so that it's always ready for guests. Whether or not guests ever come, a clean house makes for a good house to live in.

## üöã Looking Back and Looking Forward

This is a non-technical section to reflect on my previous work on this project, and for me to share what my general goals are for this version.

### üêç Version #1 - Born on a Python

<img src="assets/images/snakey_version1.PNG" align="left" width="300" />

I wrote the bulk of [the first version of this game](https://github.com/david-fong/SnaKey) in the February of 2018 using Python. At the time, I had pretty much just finished [learning Python over the Winter break](https://github.com/david-fong/Tetris), and I wanted to do something original with it. I came up with the start of an idea spinning off of the classic snake game, with a twist on the movement mechanic: to move by typing. In this version, there were color themes, basic language support (Japanese Hiragana and Katakana), and basic computer-opponents.

The idea of adding different languages came because I was taking a beginners' class in Japanese, and needed to learn its two basic alphabets. I really enjoyed that class- not just because I was interested in the content, but also because the professor was a kind person and a good teacher. Helping people practice recognizing characters from other languages has become a big motivator for my continued work on this game- for a significant part due to the positive experience I had learning Japanese at the beginners' level.

A major theme for this version was baseline design. I came up with a representation for language mappings, maintaining necessary invariants, and designing movement algorithms for the artificially controlled opponents. I also spent a lot of effort designing the game objective to motivate the player to keep moving around: The player would accumulate score points by landing on tiles highlighted in green. A pink computer-player would chase the player, ending the game if it caught them, while a blue computer-player would compete with the player for score. The pink chaser would slowly get faster, so there was a yellow computer-player that would run away from the player, bumping the chaser's speed back down a notch if the player at any time was able to catch it.

### üï∏ Version #2 - Slithering to the Web

<img src="assets/images/snakey_version2_hiragana.PNG" align="left" width="300" />

I finished that version, and excitedly showed my friends and my Japanese prof. Some were pretty enthusiastic about it. My prof was interested, but didn't have Python. I realized that accessibility was a big limiting factor with the first version. So out of a desire to change that, I started reading about how basic webpages are built up using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, and I slowly worked on porting the game to be hosted on the web via GitHub-Pages as [the second version of this game](https://github.com/david-fong/SnaKey-JS).

In this version, which I wrote the bulk of in March of 2018, I wrote everything using NotePad++, and used pure HTML, Javascript, and CSS. Looking back, I think this really set me up with a good foundational understanding of how vanilla javascript works, as opposed to what might have been the case if I started looking at various frameworks and transpiling languages right away. It has also made me appreciate the value of strong typing, and choosing conventions for things such as naming. Javascript is really so slack when it comes to such basic things that it's easy to write things that don't read well or make much sense.

Learning was a major theme of my work in this version. Unlike the first version where I had already learned the basics of the language and how it runs, here I was learning from scratch all over again. The majority of my efforts went to learning how to port over the behaviour of the previous version by reading documentation on the interfaces to javascript's basic data structures, manipulating the browser DOM, and working with CSS. I found [w3c schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) and [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) to be great learning resources. In this version, there were very few changes to the game's underlying representation, objectives, and mechanics.

### üåê Version #3 - Snakes With Wings (You are Here)

This brings us to where we are now- around November of 2019. The leading goal of this version is to push the game out to the world of internet-enabled multiplayer. Although I've recently gotten comfortable [working in the terminal environment](https://github.com/david-fong/Darcy), for this project, I decided to try using VSCode, since it looked like it would offer good intellisense for TypeScript, which I was looking to learn to use. I spent significant time learning how to set up linting for TypeScript with VSCode, and learning about ES6's native module system. I was really impressed with how good the integration is between VSCode and various plugins and typing constructs.

You might think that after making this game twice I'd be tired of it. But that's not at all the case. For one thing, I see so many opportunities to improve on my previous work. After all, learning has been a major motivation for this project from the start. In each version of this project, I try to make it more and more accessible to people. I for one, cannot wait for the day when I can sit down and play this game together with a group of friends or perhaps even with complete strangers.

## üõ© Design Challenges & Stepping up my Game

I envision this version to be the last remake- again, not at all because I'm tired of it, but because I finally have the tools and know-how to build up a maintainable code base. Both of the previous versions suffered from three main problems- largely due to me being new to the language. Before I can talk about those problems, solving them, and why solving them is necessary for this version, I need to talk about what makes this version so different.

One of the big challenges for this project is to give the user the choice between playing completely offline (after fetching all the game's HTTP objects), and playing online. I like this challenge because it really demands designing a good function API, and working with inheritence to share as much code as possible. This isn't a trivial task given an overview of what each piece of the picture needs to accomplish:

|                                            | Offline | Server | Client |
:-------------------------------------------:|:-------:|:------:|:------:|
| Maintain the master copy of the game state | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_multiplication_x: |
| Display the game state via the browser DOM | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_multiplication_x: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Use network operations to exchange events  | :heavy_multiplication_x: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |

This means that the code that receives a request for something like player movement and performs validation must be in a separate function from that which enacts all changes to all parts of the game state that are affected by an acceptance of the request. In addition to that, SocketIO can only guarantee that application messages will arrive in order if the client is using websockets for its underlying transport, which, while common, is not an absolute given, and is indeed not the case before a temporary long-polling connection upgrades to use websockets. This means that these request processing and executing functions must use event-ID systems to handle out-of-order message arrivals.

### üßó‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Stepping up my Game (pun intended)

Now that we understand the start of why the design requires so much more care in this version, we can talk about the solving the problems plaguing the two earlier versions.

|        Topic        | The What and Why of the Problem | The Solution and its Necessity |
|:-------------------:|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| üìÅ<br>Modularity    | | |
| ü¶Ü<br>Inheritance   | | |
| üìÑ<br>Documentation | Unlike the other problems, this wasn't due to not knowing about or understanding how to use a language feature. Rather, it was a problem of values: At the time, writing documentation didn't feel like it mattered. The code was _relatively_ small and simple, and on top of that, I had no IDE to show documentation on mouseover, so any documentation I wrote wasn't even very accessible to me. | The solution here is to be intentional. And to be honest, I may not even need that. As the design becomes more complicated to address the new design requirements, I have a more critical need to clearly communicate a function's purpose. And as I design my function API's, I come across more situations where I need to make a judgement call on which functions in a call chain should handle certain functionalities. Writing good documentation allows me to stop wasting time reading my previous code to remember what it is being held responsible to do. |

## ü§∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è My Joy in TypeScript

In all my experience working with Java (Ie. my first semester of second year uni, my first COOP terms of 4 months, and [in another of my main personal projects](https://github.com/david-fong/UbcCourseSchedulingTool)), The things I have loved most about it are its strong language spec, how strong typing is baked into the grammar, and the resulting ability for good a IDE to make the task of writing code a better experience. That's why as I started breaking into TypeScript and eslint in this project, my heart felt like it was flying.

Here, I want to share ways that I've been leveraging and combining Javascript and TypeScript features to make my code more flexible, organized, and better documented, and what I think those features have over Java. To be clear, I'm not trying to throw dirt at Java. As I said, the whole reason for my love-at-first-sight feeling with TypeScript was that it allowed me to write code like I can in Java. What I'm trying to do here is share things that excite me about TypeScript, and how it adds to my development experience in a way that Java cannot. I could just the same do the reverse, but that's not the point of this section.

### üç± Bundling Constructor Arguments as Objects

This is something that can be done in plain Javascript. It serves three purposes:

#### üë£ Footprint Reduction

This basically nullifies any problems with function signature bloat. Compared to Java, creating and defining the shapes of objects in JavaScript is much less verbose, so using this technique is convenient. This comes at the cost of writing more code (specifying field-names in addition to values) when calling constructors, but if a constructor is called seldomly, and the inheritence heirarchy is large with next-to-identical constructor signatures, then you come out on the winning side.

#### üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Flexibility

It makes constructor signatures incredibly malleable. If I need to add, remove, or change the type of an argument, I can simply modify the object bundle and the relevant handler code, and leave the rest of the constructors of extending classes untouched. I discovered this out of need: If you traverse [the entire `Player` class tree](src/base/player), there are at least eight constructors, and therefore at least the same number of sites where such constructors are called. Could you solve this particular issue by using a good IDE? Yes. But reduced reliance on an IDE for refactoring means less hassle; Not all IDE's are good at function signature refactoring, especially when it comes to [the duck-typing model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing).

#### üìõ Explicit Argument Mapping

Unlike passing arguments in an argument list, this requires wrapping arguments in an object, where mapping the value from the argument / object-field name is mandatory. This makes it _very_ difficult to pass arguments in "the wrong order", because now order is meaningless. All the cognitive effort is migrated to using good object-field and variable names, which is much more intuitive and robust.

---

### üß© Type Aliases and Declaration Merging

Get this- you can type alias a primitive type to give it a name suited to a use-case, and then _document it_. A prime example of the difference this makes in this project is in the `Player.Id` type. It aliases to mean a number. Each player has a unique ID, and there are semantics to value ranges: Strictly negative values are for computer-controlled players, strictly positive values for human-controlled players, and the value zero to indicate that a Tile has no occupant.

#### üî¢ Documenting Primitives

Type Aliases in TypeScript are very much like the `typedef` keyword in C: They allow you to give a type annotation a meaningful name, and to centralize documentation on the semantics of fields and variables of that type. When documenting function arguments, sometimes it is even enough to just let the type annotation do the talking.

#### üì¶ "Scoped" TypeDefs and Validators

Using TypeScript's declaration merging capabilities, type declarations can be put under a namespace. Instead of writing `export type PlayerId` outside of a namespace, which pollutes the global type-declaration group and adds to module-import clutter, I can write something like:

```typescript
// <docuentation>
export class Player {
    idNumber: Player.Id;
    <...>
}
export namespace Player {
    // <documentation>
    export type Id = number;
    export namespace Id {
        // <documentation>
        export const NULL = 0;
    }
}
```

The example shows how namespace merging allows you to scope type declarations, and make it look like they declare special constants. With fields like usernames, this can be used to scope regular expression checkers under the type alias. In Java, you can't alias primitive types, [and that's final (ü•Å)](https://stackoverflow.com/a/28238107/11107541). In C, you can alias anything, but you can't scope type definitions unless you are using C++. In TypeScript, you can do both, and I think that's super cool.

// I have to tell a story:
//
// For the past six days, I've been voraciously reading documentation
// on configuring WebPack and trying it out, and then I went down a new
// rabbit hole with Project References in TypeScript. As I tore things
// up to try it and get something working, I realized that since it
// would require emitting and using type declaration files, I would
// need to update those every time I made a change and needed it else-
// where. Either that would mean setting up a watcher, or adding a step
// to my most basic development process. This was vexing, and I assumed
// the message in the TypeScript documentation on developing ways to
// circumvent this wouldn't be a blessing I would enjoy in the lifetime
// of this project.
//
// Today on December 12th, 2019, Vscode released an update. I installed
// it, and skimmed the change log, and jumped to the JS/TS section, got
// led to a big external document, realized it was about a new version
// of TypeScript (released November 5th), started skimming, finished,
// and was about to close it when a heading on Project References caught
// my eye. It was the very thing I had been holding a last thread of hope
// for. I had only just ten minutes ago completed a first-run of emitting
// declaration files for my project sources.
//
// Even though the TypeScript update came out a month ago, finding it
// now, I feel like Christmas came early this year.

# Game Ideas

## Points of Consideration

First thing first: I want game ideas to be simple to implement, since I want there to be multiple game modes. Right now, the goal is to generate many simple ideas, and then see what mechanics are the most shared between them, which will then become part of the game's core.

The greatest design challenge here is to accommodate for a wide range of skill. This game is somewhat special in that the most fundamental mechanic- that is, movement- is not throttled in any way by the game; instead, it is throttled by each player's ability.

One final note: try to think of ways to frame the game as some part of the real world in a way that gives it charm or enforces the atmosphere you want to create (intense/chill, collaborative/competitive). I'm talking about using the visuals to turn the game into a familiar "story". Without that, this game is just another boring typing game. This game doesn't have to just be a way to hone a skill or pit yourself against others with that skill.

## Singleplayer

I think singleplayer game modes are well suited with games that do not end and take one of the following approaches:

1. "Treadmill". The game provides a challenge where the difficulty can be dynamically controlled by the player.
1. "Bubble-wrap". The game provides repeating small goals, and makes no attempt to be challenging, and instead simply feels rewarding.

## Multiplayer

To accommodate for varying skill levels when choosing to hide notions of competition/comparison, design games with different player roles/goals.

## Endorsed Ideas

### Death Scroller

Simplicity score: 9/10.

- The floor is rising lava. Keep moving up and see how long you survive.
- Optional additional challenge: every once in a while, the tile you are on will crumble and not come back.
- Possible "stories": Running against an escalator and dodging people using it properly.

### Bubble Wrap Stories

- Being a bunch of baby turtles walking to the sea.
- Being a cat and pushing things off a counter top.

### Soccer

Simplicity score: 3/10.

- Can hold and shoot a ball.
- For each step you take with the ball, you will stay frozen after losing it until the next people who pick it up have moved that many steps with the ball.
  - Or that the ball moves while it is not being held by anyone.
- For each step you take with the ball, the radius that it can be stolen from by an enemy team member increases.

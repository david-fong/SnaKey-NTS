Maybe I should just rename this repo to "typing-game"... :P

## Soccer

- Can hold and shoot a ball.
- For each step you take with the ball, you will stay frozen after losing it until the next people who pick it up have moved that many steps with the ball.
- For each step you take with the ball, the radius that it can be stolen from by an enemy team member increases.

## Weird Hangman Variant

- Everybody is running around except for one person.
- That one person is in a separate space with regular WASD-type movement.
  - They have a phrase they need to get everyone else to guess as fast as possible.
  - They must press the number of a player ID when that player is over the letter of the space that they are over.
  - If successful, that space will be revealed to the rest of the players, thus making it easier for them to guess what letters they should suggest for the revealer.
- The aim of the game is to reveal the phrase as fast as possible.
